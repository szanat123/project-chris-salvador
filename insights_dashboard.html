                <h4>1. Housing Prices vs. Median Income by State</h4>
                <p>This scatter plot shows the relationship between average housing prices and median incomes for various U.S. states. The data comes from national housing reports and census records, providing insights into income and housing affordability. This visualization highlights disparities across regions, reflecting both demand-supply dynamics and regional economic strengths or weaknesses.<br>
                <strong>Key Insights:</strong><br>
                1) Affordability Disparity: States like Maryland exhibit significantly higher housing prices relative to income levels, indicating potential affordability issues for residents.<br>
                2) Income Variability: States with higher median incomes (>$80k) still show broad variation in housing prices. For example, states like California exhibit much higher prices despite higher incomes. <br>
                3) Outliers: States such as California display extreme housing costs, likely driven by demand pressures, limited housing supply, and regional economic activity.</p>
